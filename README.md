# Codes-for-GBE
The relevant R software codes for monitoring the GBE distribution are provided. The corresponding file name of the monitoring scheme is as follows：  
MCUSUM chart：MCUSUM for GBE  
MEWMA chart: MEWMA for GBE  
GBE-EWMA-TS-1 scheme: two-sided EWMA for scheme 1  
GBE-EWMA-TS-2 scheme: two-sided EWMA for scheme 2  
Lower-sided GBE-EWMA-TS-1 scheme: lower-sided EWMA for scheme 1  
Upper-sided GBE-EWMA-TS-1 scheme: upper-sided EWMA for scheme 1  
Lower-sided GBE-EWMA-TS-2 scheme: lower-sided EWMA for scheme 2  
Upper-sided GBE-EWMA-TS-2 scheme: upper-sided EWMA for scheme 2  
Code for example 1: Phase II monitoring of Example 1  
Code for example 2: Phase II monitoring of Example 2  
Code for example 3: Phase II monitoring of Example 3  
Raw dataset for example 1: SMS1  
Raw dataset for example 2: DRS1  
Raw dataset for example 3: CCF1
